	abstract = {Whole-cloth quilts are decorative and functional artifacts made of plain cloth embellished with complicated stitching patterns. We describe a method that can automatically create a sewing pattern for a whole-cloth quilt from a photograph. Our technique begins with a segmented image, extracts desired and optional edges, and creates a continuous sewing path by approximately solving the Rural Postman Problem (RPP). In addition to many example quilts, we provide visual and numerical comparisons to previous singleline illustration approaches.},

	abstract = {We introduce a differentiable rasterizer that bridges the vector graphics and raster image domains, enabling powerful raster-based loss functions, optimization procedures, and machine learning techniques to edit and generate vector content. We observe that vector graphics rasterization is differentiable after pixel prefiltering. Our differentiable rasterizer offers two prefiltering options: an analytical prefiltering technique and a multisampling anti-aliasing technique. The analytical variant is faster but can suffer from artifacts such as conflation. The multisampling variant is still efficient, and can render high-quality images while computing unbiased gradients for each pixel with respect to curve parameters. We demonstrate that our rasterizer enables new applications, including a vector graphics editor guided by image metrics, a painterly rendering algorithm that fits vector primitives to an image by minimizing a deep perceptual loss function, new vector graphics editing algorithms that exploit well-known image processing methods such as seam carving, and deep generative models that generate vector content from raster-only supervision under a VAE or GAN training objective.},

We propose a method for synthesizing stripe patterns on triangulated surfaces, where singularities are automatically inserted in order to achieve user-specified orientation and line spacing. Patterns are characterized as global minimizers of a convex-quadratic energy which is well-defined in the smooth setting. Computation amounts to finding the principal eigenvector of a symmetric positive-definite matrix with the same sparsity as the standard graph Laplacian. The resulting patterns are globally continuous, and can be applied to a variety of tasks in design and texture synthesis.},

The author also presents a large collection of intersection and distance tests for both simple and complex geometric shapes. Sections on vector and matrix algebra provide the background for advanced topics such as Voronoi regions, Minkowski sums, and linear and quadratic programming.Of utmost importance to programmers but rarely discussed in this much detail in other books are the chapters covering numerical and geometric robustness, both essential topics for collision detection systems. Also unique are the chapters discussing how graphics hardware can assist in collision detection computations and on advanced optimization for modern computer architectures. All in all, this comprehensive book will become the industry standard for years to come.},

	abstract = {We study the color reproduction of full-color metallic-ink images. Full-color metallic-ink images are prints whose contributing colorants are exclusively made of colored metallic inks. Due to the presence of metallic particles, metallic inks show a metal-like luster. These particles are opaque and hide the underlying ink or substrate. In order to obtain predictable halftone colors, we need a juxtaposed halftoning method to create halftone dots of different colors side by side without overlapping. Juxtaposed halftoning invalidates many assumptions generally made for the color-reproduction workflow. For printing metallic-ink images, one needs a color-separation system creating surface coverages for the eight metallic inks that correspond to the eight Neugebauer primaries. For this purpose, we introduce a simple and fast method for N-color separation that relies either on Demichel's or on a variant of Kueppers' ink-to-colorant separations. Thanks to a unique set of ink-to-colorant formulas, pseudo-CMY ink values are separated into amounts of printable colorants. We also describe color-separation procedures that are able to optimize different properties of the resulting metallic-ink images. (C) 2016 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.},

Indeed the control of the density of the field is very easy since the user only needs to set the separating distance between adjacent streamlines, which is related to the overall density of the image. We show that our method produces images of a quality at least as good as other methods but that it is computationally less expensive and offers a better control on the rendering process.},

In contrast with filters that operate on the three bands of a color image separately, a bilateral filter can enforce the perceptual metric underlying the CIE-Lab color space, and smooth colors and preserve edges in a way that is tuned to human perception. Also, in contrast with standard filtering, bilateral filtering produces no phantom colors along edges in color images, and reduces phantom colors where they appear in the original image.},

	abstract = {We introduce three natural and well-defined generaliza-tions of maximal Poisson-disk sampling. The first is to decouple the disk-free (inhibition) radius from the max-imality (coverage) radius. Selecting a smaller inhibition radius than the coverage radius yields samples which mix advantages of Poisson-disk and uniform-random samplings. The second generalization yields hierarchical samplings, by scaling inhibition and coverage radii by an abstract parameter, e.g. time. The third generaliza-tion is to allow the radii to vary spatially, according to a formally characterized sizing function. We state bounds on edge lengths and angles in a Delaunay triangulation of the points, dependent on the ratio of inhibition to coverage radii, or the sizing function's Lipschitz con-stant. Hierarchical samplings have distributions similar to those created directly.},

Our greedy approach generates placements of comparable quality with respect to the optimization approach from Turk and Banks, while being 200 times faster. Simplicity, robustness as well as efficiency is achieved through the use of a Delaunay triangulation to model the streamlines, address proximity queries and determine the biggest voids by exploiting the empty circle property.

By calling a single procedure in every pixel - or voxel - large quantities of details are generated at low cost, enhancing textures, producing complex structures within and along surfaces. Such procedures are typically implemented as pixel shaders. We propose a novel procedural pattern synthesis technique that exhibits desirable properties for modeling highly contrasted patterns, that are especially well suited to produce surface and microstructure details. In particular, our synthesizer affords for a precise control over the profile, orientation and distribution of the produced stochastic patterns, while allowing to grade all these parameters spatially. Our technique defines a stochastic smooth phase field - a phasor noise - that is then fed into a periodic function (e.g. a sine wave), producing an oscillating field with prescribed main frequencies and preserved contrast oscillations. In addition, the profile of each oscillation is directly controllable (e.g. sine wave, sawtooth, rectangular or any 1D profile). Our technique builds upon a reformulation of Gabor noise in terms of a phasor field that affords for a clear separation between local intensity and phase. Applications range from texturing to modeling surface displacements, as well as multi-material microstructures in the context of additive manufacturing.},

Yet, most of the objects we fabricate are comparatively rather inexpressive, either rigid or exhibiting simple homogeneous deformations when interacted with. We explore the synthesis and fabrication of novel microstructures that mimic the effects of having oriented rigid fibers in an otherwise flexible material: the result is extremely rigid along a transverse direction while being comparatively very flexible in the locally orthogonal plane. By allowing free gradation of the rigidity direction orientation within the object, the microstructures can be designed such that, under deformation, distances along fibers in the volume are preserved while others freely change. Through a simple painting tool, this allows a designer to influence the way the volume reshapes when deformed, and results in a wide range of novel possibilities. Many gradations are possible: local free orientation of the fibers; local control of the overall material rigidity (structure density); local canceling of the effect of the fibers, obtaining a more isotropic material. Our algorithm to synthesize the structures builds upon procedural texturing. It produces a cellular geometry that can be fabricated reliably despite 3D printing walls at a minimal thickness, allowing prints to be very flexible. The synthesis algorithm is efficient and scales to large volumes.},
